# Mineborium mod
Mineborium mod is a Minecraft mod developed using [MinecraftForge Mod loader](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/).

This mod is based and developed around the well known American brand of cigarettes Marlboro which inspired most of the ideas and implementations in the development.

This is our first mod developed for Minecraft. It all started as a joke between friends, we started joking about adding "Marlborium" in the game until one day taking advantage of my previous Java knowledge I started researching on the subject and started a new "small" project.

# Installation
### Direct download (Recommended)
You can donwload the .jar file going to the releases section of this repository and getting the version you need for your Minecraft version. Once you have the mods .jar file you can install it like every other mod:

_Note: Before doing the following steps you should install [MinecraftForge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/) if you haven't done it before._

1. Press `Windows+R` and write `%appdata%`.
2. Go to the **.minecraft** folder.
3. There you should find a **mods** folder.
4. Drop the .jar file in the mods folder

### Compiling yourself
**IMPORTANT: I don't recommend using this option unless you know what you are doing.**

If you are feeling brave you can compile the mod yourself using this repository.

1. Clone this repository using git or downloading it directly.
2. Open it with IntelliJ or your preferent IDE and setup the Gradle dependencies
3. Run the following terminal command to compile the code: `.\gradlew build`
4. If the previous command worked fine it will have generated your .jar file in `build/libs`
5. From there you can follow the steps in the **Direct download** section.
